Modussy (aka Flopcraft)
---
A very s3xy and aesthetic Minecraft mod

As of right now, Modussy currently has support for Minecraft Java versions 1.19.2 and 1.20.1 on forge API.
A fabric port will likely get made some day however, it will likely be in a separate repository.

**Requests**

I am aware that some of you wants me to add specific things into Modussy (things like LovelyPeaches
and deeldoughs) and I will state that for items, blocks, entities/mobs, and structures, I will try
to get to them as soon as I can. However, since I have other projects I'm making at the moment along
with the fact that I'm still relatively new to the java programming language, necessary for modding
Minecraft itself, it will take me a bit.

However, I will not be taking any requests for porting Modussy to older versions of Minecraft since
I will have to basically figure out how to redo some very complicated parts of Modussy's source code.
And I will especially not be porting Modussy to Bedrock as I'm pretty certain that not only does
Bedrock have a safeguard against modding, but also that Bedrock is written in a language I am currently
unfamiliar with. However, if any of you reading this have a thorough understanding of Java and Minecraft
code and you are up for the task, Modussy's source code is open source and you are all free to port
Modussy to older versions of Minecraft. This applies to you C++ people versed in Bedrock code.

For anyone asking me to port Modussy to fabric, I will be doing that at some point, however, like adding
items and stuff, it will take me a bit of time.

**Why Modussy Isn't On Curseforge**

After reading Curseforge's terms of service, I believe that some features of Modussy, namely
CupcakKe's texture, specific items, and mobs violates it, so the download links are in this
repository instead. Click <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/Modussy/releases/download/v1.19.2-0.0>here</a>
for the most recent version uploaded (Modussy-0.0.3 for Minecraft 1.19.2 Forge API 43.1.47) and
<a href="https://github.com/NukolLodda/Modussy/tags">here</a> for every available
version of Modussy.

**Where Are Modussy's Aesthetic Music**

It is noted that the music discs were removed to prevent any copyright claims on to my mod
however, if you want to listen to music using this mod, you have to record a song down and
convert it to an ogg file using this link - https://convertio.co/

**Downloading Aesthetic Music Files For Modussy**

If you download the file itself as a .jar, the file extension is easy to be renamed as .zip in order
to allow you to add the music disc files. (After adding the music disc files, you MUST rename the .zip
back to a .jar file or Minecraft's not going to load the mod)
The following directory is where the music disc sound files should end up:

assets/modussy/sounds

It is also noted that a texture pack can also be made to allow the sounds below to be accessible
however, it is important and very crucial that you MUST convert all sound files for the mod into .ogg files

___
the music disc's supposed sound files are recorded from the following videos:

(note: the music file must be named what the entry is or else the sound won't play in game)
