Modussy (Aka Flopcraft)
---
A very s3xy and aesthetic Minecraft mod

As of right now, Modussy currently has support for Minecraft Java versions 1.19.2 on forge API,
with the 1.20.1 version being a work in progress that should be out soon.
A fabric port will likely get made some day however, it will likely be in a separate repository.

**Requests**

I am aware that some of you wants me to add specific things into Modussy and for items, blocks, entities/mobs,
and structures, I will try to get to them as soon as I can. However, since I have other projects I'm making
at the moment along with the fact that Modussy's complexity has a tendency to require tons of debugging,
it will take me a bit. However, I will NOT be taking EVERY request thrown my way which I'd do if the request
in question is too complicated for someone my level or that it just doesn't feel right in Modussy.

I will however, not be taking any requests for porting Modussy to other versions of Minecraft since
I would have to basically figure out how to redo entire segments of Modussy's source code, which will take
me weeks if not months, and I will especially not be porting Modussy to Bedrock as I'm pretty certain
that not only does Bedrock have a safeguard against modding, but also that Bedrock is written in a
language I am currently unfamiliar with. However, if any of you reading this have a thorough
understanding of programming and Minecraft code and you are up for the task, I give you full permission to
fork this project and port Modussy to older versions of Minecraft or Bedrock.

**Why Modussy Isn't On Curseforge**

After reading Curseforge's terms of service, I believe that some features of Modussy, namely
CupcakKe's texture, specific items, and mobs violates it, so the download links are in this
repository instead. Click <a href=https://github.com/NukolLodda/Modussy/releases/download/v1.19.2-0.0>here</a>
for the most recent version uploaded (Modussy-0.0.3 for Minecraft 1.19.2 Forge API 43.1.47) and
<a href="https://github.com/NukolLodda/Modussy/tags">here</a> for every available
version of Modussy.

**Where Are Modussy's Aesthetic Music**

It is noted that the music discs were removed to prevent any copyright claims on to my mod
however, if you want to listen to music using this mod, you have to record a song down and
convert it to an ogg file using <a href="https://convertio.co/">this link</a>
